# Incident Response Strategy for Complex Multi-Vector Attacks

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive paper detailing a **MITRE ATT&CK-aligned incident response strategy** for handling complex multi-vector cyberattacks.  
The document includes methodology, a real-world inspired Azure compromise case study, and a detailed incident response playbook covering all stages from detection to post-incident review.

## Key Features
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Every phase of the incident response aligns with MITRE tactics.
